# Portfolio Generator ðŸš€

> **About this project**

> This project is part of a personal challenge: I set out to ideate, design, and develop an AI-powered app in a single afternoon. As such, the codebase has plenty of room for improvement and is intentionally simple.

Create and share your professional portfolio in minutes, powered by an AI assistant that suggests personalized improvements.

## What is Portfolio Generator?
